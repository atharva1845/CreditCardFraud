Credit Card Fraud Detection 🔍💳
A machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using various classification techniques. This project aims to improve fraud detection accuracy while minimizing false positives, helping financial institutions secure their systems against fraud.

📌 Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, scaling, and preparing data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into transaction patterns and fraud trends.
Model Building: Training and evaluating classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Performance Metrics: Analysis using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve.
Visualization: Interactive charts and graphs for better understanding and interpretation of results.
📂 Dataset
The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle, consisting of anonymized credit card transactions with labeled fraudulent cases.

Rows: 284,807 transactions
Features: 31 columns, including Time, Amount, and anonymized variables V1-V28.
Target: Class (1 for fraud, 0 for legitimate transactions).
